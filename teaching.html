                        (But in short, if you're wondering... During my time at Stanford, I spent five years
                        teaching and improving CS education at Stanford by training and managing over 150
                        teaching assistants, lecturing the introductory course, writing new curricula in Python,
                        and developing a companion class that is catered to educationally disadvantaged students.
                        My contributions were recognized with Stanford’s university-wide Centennial Teaching
                        Assistant Award in 2021.)

                        <b> Disadvantaged Students |</b> I am especially proud of my work on a companion course
                        (CS100A) for Stanford’s introductory CS class, which was catered to first-generation,
                        educationally disadvantaged, and underrepresented students who want to pursue STEM.
                        I developed the curriculum for this class and taught it for five quarters, supporting
                        133 students in total. I worked to not only reinforce the core material but also teach
                        important academic skills and provide general support as a mentor (which was much needed
                        for students isolated during an international pandemic). I created many materials to facilitate
                        the expansion of the companion-course program to other computer science classes.

                        <b>Scaling High-Quality Education |</b> I care deeply about not only improving the quality of support
                        for students but also improving the accessibility (and scalability) of computer science education.
                        In Spring 2020, I participated in Stanford’s Code in Place, a shelter-in-place-inspired initiative
                        that taught introductory computer science to students all over the world. I trained 15 TAs, and I
                        wrote problems (e.g. using image processing to identify forest fires) that were solved by over
                        8,000 students.

                        Inclusivity for Teaching Assistants | I served as a coordinator in Stanford’s Section Leading
                        undergraduate teaching assistant program for five quarters, where I hired and trained 30 new TAs
                        each quarter and managed around 100 TAs total (serving about 1000 students) each quarter. I made
                        changes in our hiring process to increase outreach to underrepresented communities and provide
                        additional support and feedback to candidates, increasing hiring rates. Over the course of my
                        15-month tenure, the percentage of first-gen TAs hired doubled, and the percentage of new TAs
                        first exposed to coding during college (as opposed to pre-college) increased from 5% to 35%. I
                        additionally worked to revamp the inclusive teaching practices training for TAs, following Colleen
                        Lewis’s work in CS Teaching Tips. With this improved curriculum, I trained over 150 TAs. In 2019,
                        I spoke on a panel at SIGCSE, discussing my work with the Section Leading program so that other
                        institutions could learn and form similar programs.

                        <b>Lecturing & Impactful Curriculum |</b> During Summer 2019, I served as a lecturer for Stanford’s
                        introductory computer science class, teaching 150 students. I worked with Chris Piech, Mehran
                        Sahami, and Marty Stepp to develop new materials to facilitate the class’ transition from Java
                        to Python. Many of the new materials were geared toward showcasing how computer science can be
                        used for positive social impact, such as the assignment I developed that involved analyzing and
                        visualizing historical pollution data in California. I have seen first-hand how many students
                        develop a passion for CS (and STEM more broadly) when they discover its potential positive impacts.
